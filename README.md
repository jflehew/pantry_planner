 Pantry Planner Personal/School Project

Pantry planner is meant to be an application to help manage your pantry and other common household items. 

Stack: I will be using a (python)Flask backend and a (js)React front end 
CSS: I would like to work with bootstrap for the front end styling
Features:
    1. a pantry to show consumable items you have in your household and how many you have.
    2. A grocery list which automatically updates based on a threshold for each consumable item. 
        a. shopping will remove all items from your gorcery list automatically and update your pantry. 
        b. did not buy button will prevent item from updating and removing itself from the grocery list
    3. recipes/actions created by users to help manage your pantry. 
        a. recipes will have a rating and a favorite button
        b. cooking a recipe will update your pantry and grocery list accordingly. 
        c. the ability to add an item to your grocery list will appear if that product id isn't found in your pantry
    4. api  connection to kroger products (possibly locations) for the purpose of adding products and getting accurate prices
    5. Login and registration for all users. 

Future features:
    1. I would like to track weekly usage and weekly costs for the user to help better manage expendature.
    2. connect to more API's to give users more versatility with shopping. 
    3. cart adaptability to allow users to add items to a cart for the store each item is associated with and purchase those items from the app to be ready for pickup. 
    4. shared grocery lists between multiple users for household use.
